### This project aims to create a bot that you can write as many options as you have, and it will randomly choose for you.

## Example:
 
 Let's say you're undecided about which series you should watch.
 
 The options in your mind are ***Sherlock, How I Met Yor Mother, Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad and Supernatural***.
 
 Just write these options and the bot will choose.
